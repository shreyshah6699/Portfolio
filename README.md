* **Summary:**
  * With 3+ years of extensive experience in AI system development, I specialize in the entire lifecycle of foundational model training, finetuning, retrieval-augmented systems, and rigorous model evaluation. Proficient in architecting Large Language Models (LLMs), creating
targeted instruction datasets, and implementing quantization and inference optimizations, I enhance system performance significantly.
My proven project management skills cover problem definition, data acquisition, and full-cycle deployment, utilizing tools like MLflow
and cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. My expertise extends to both proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude,
and open-source models including Llama and Mistral, ensuring the delivery of high-performing, scalable, and cost-efficient AI solutions.
Additionally, I leverage IDE tools such as PyCharm, RStudio, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Google Collab, and Navicat for
efficient development, and utilize NLP libraries like NLTK, spaCy, GPT-3, BERT, and Hugging Face's Transformers to create
sophisticated natural language processing solutions.
